          <article>
            At ML Strength, we believe that fitness is not just a fad, but a way
            of life.
            <br />
            Our experienced trainers are all Les Mills accredited and have
            Bachelor Degrees in Human Movements, ensuring that you receive the
            highest level of training and guidance.
            <br />
            <br />
            We offer a wide range of group fitness classes, including popular
            options like Zumba, Body Pump, Yoga, and Pilates, as well as more
            specialized classes like boxing and karate.
            <br />
            Our class timetable changes constantly, so be sure to check our
            website for the latest schedule at each of our clubs. In addition to
            group fitness classes, we also offer one-on-one personal training
            sessions for weight loss, circuit training, boxing, and karate. Our
            trainers will work with you to develop a customized workout plan that
            is tailored to your individual needs and goals.
            <br />
            <br />
            At ML Strength, we pride ourselves on our 'no obligation, no pressure'
            attitude. Unlike other health clubs, we do not employ annoying
            telemarketers or membership consultants. We believe that our gyms
            speak for themselves, and our members are our best advertisement. We
            welcome you to visit any of our gyms at your own pace, with no
            pressure whatsoever. And with our $10 casual visit rate, you can try
            us out without any long-term commitment.
