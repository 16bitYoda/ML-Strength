          <article>
            <p>
              Our range of group fitness classes includes everything from Body
              Attack and Zumba to Yoga and Tai Chi, with something for everyone at
              any fitness level.
              <br />
              <br />
              Whether your goal is weight loss, body building, nutrition or diet
              improvements, having more energy, or just looking and feeling better,
              we're here to help you achieve it.
              <br />
              <br />
              At ML Strength, we are a family operated business that has little to
              do with the rest of the fitness industry. We believe that word of
              mouth has way more credibility than something that a marketing machine
              dreams up, and our members do our marketing for us.
              <br />
              <br />
              You are always welcome to look with our 'No obligation, No pressure'
              attitude, our $10 CASUAL visit rate, and our commitment to providing
              you with the best possible fitness experience. We pride ourselves on
              being a refreshing change from the hard-selling 'health club' sales
              consultants that you may have encountered elsewhere.

        <h2>Workouts For Everyone</h2>
        <p> 
            At ML Strength, we believe that fitness is not just a fad, but a way
            of life.
            <br />
            Our experienced trainers are all Les Mills accredited and have
            Bachelor Degrees in Human Movements, ensuring that you receive the
            highest level of training and guidance.
            <br />
            <br />
            We offer a wide range of group fitness classes, including popular
            options like Zumba, Body Pump, Yoga, and Pilates, as well as more
            specialized classes like boxing and karate.
            <br />
            Our class timetable changes constantly, so be sure to check <span id="link-to-timetable"><a href="https://16bityoda.github.io/ML-Strength/pages/services.html#timetable">BELOW</a></span> for the latest schedule at each of our clubs.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to
            group fitness classes, we also offer one-on-one personal training
            sessions for weight loss, circuit training, boxing, and karate. Our
            trainers will work with you to develop a customized workout plan
            that is tailored to your individual needs and goals.
            <br />
            <br />
            At ML Strength, we pride ourselves on our 'no obligation, no
            pressure' attitude. Unlike other health clubs, we do not employ
            annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. We believe that
            our gyms speak for themselves, and our members are our best
            advertisement. We welcome you to visit any of our gyms at your own
            pace, with no pressure whatsoever. And with our $10 casual visit
            rate, you can try us out without any long-term commitment.
